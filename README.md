# Doorplate AR

This project contains a small app developed at #zCamp2018.
It uses ARKit and Azure Cognitive Services in order to augment the doorplates in the venue of the camp with the shortnames of the topic teams that are working in the respective rooms.

In order to use the app, you'll need an Azure Cognitive Service API key.
